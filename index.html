        <p>We're Mike and Caroline Hudack. We met in New York City more than a decade ago. We live in rural Cambridgeshire with our daughters <a href="marla.html">Marla</a> and Ada, a family of ducks, a clan of badgers, some Muntjac deer and assorted other wildlife. We try to grow as much of our own food as possible.</p>
        <p>We've been building and marketing things on the internet for a long time. We also angel invest in new companies in the US and UK. We only invest where we believe we can both add value.</p>
