    <h1>PeopleCLI Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="note">PeopleCLI is an independent tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by LinkedIn Corporation.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>PeopleCLI is a command-line tool that helps users identify potential job candidates within their LinkedIn network who may be a good fit for a given job description. We value your privacy and are committed to handling your data responsibly. This policy explains what information we process, how we use it, and your rights.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>2. Information We Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Credentials or tokens you provide</strong> (if any). These are used to access your LinkedIn data via your account. By default they are stored <em>locally</em> on your machine unless you configure otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>Job description text</strong> you provide for candidate matching.</li>
      <li><strong>Network data</strong> (e.g., names, job titles, companies, and other profile details visible to you on LinkedIn, including publicly available data) retrieved through your account access.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (e.g., command execution logs, errors, basic telemetry) — collected only if you opt in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PeopleCLI does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect private messages or special category/sensitive personal data. Do not input such data into the tool.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Match job descriptions to potential candidates in your LinkedIn network.</li>
      <li>Display candidate matches and basic profile context to you.</li>
      <li>Improve performance and user experience (only if optional telemetry is enabled).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>By default, all data is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your machine.</li>
      <li>If you configure external storage (e.g., cloud, database), it is under your control; you are responsible for access management and security of those systems.</li>
      <li>We recommend safeguarding credentials via your OS keychain or a secrets manager and using least-privilege access.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>PeopleCLI interacts with LinkedIn solely to retrieve data you are permitted to access with your account. Your use of LinkedIn is governed by LinkedIn’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Agreement</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>, and (if applicable) <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Terms</a>. You must comply with those terms, including restrictions on scraping, storing, and redistribution.</p>
    <p>We do not share your information with other third parties except as required by law.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export personal data we process, and to object to or restrict certain processing. Exercising these rights may affect functionality. Contact us to make a request.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> You can export your local PeopleCLI data (e.g., matches, logs) at any time by copying or deleting the files stored on your machine.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You can disable optional telemetry at any time via a configuration flag or environment variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>PeopleCLI retains data only as long as necessary to provide the tool’s functionality. Because storage is local by default, you control retention. You can remove cached data, tokens, and logs at any time by deleting the relevant files or uninstalling the tool.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>PeopleCLI does not transfer data to us by default. If you choose to sync data to services outside your jurisdiction, you are responsible for ensuring appropriate transfer mechanisms (e.g., SCCs) with those providers.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>PeopleCLI is not intended for use by children under 16 and should not be used to process children’s data.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected in the version distributed with the tool and on our website or repository.</p>
    <hr>
