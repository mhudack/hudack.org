I help build things on the internet. I'm Chief Product Officer at Monzo and an independent board member at VidIQ. I've previously helped build parts of Time Inc, the National Hockey League, Blip, Facebook and Deliveroo.

I live in the UK. I grew up in Connecticut and previously lived in New York City and San Francisco.
